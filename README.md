## Introduction
* A Live Coding environment &amp; Daw experimentation leveraging websockets (ToneJS/React/Meteor)
* A surely far too ambitious project 

## Why
 * Its like a Daw using live coding as its base 
 * Multiscreens using websockets. For the initial design I plan to have 
    * a main screen (live coding and sounds explorer, on desktop)
    * a mixer screen (all the knobs and other sounds modifiers, controlled on an ipad)
    * a video screen (a canvas which will evolve according to some musical parameter, projected or on TV screens)

## Current State
Under intensive care right now, should reach a first usable state + some docs soonish
